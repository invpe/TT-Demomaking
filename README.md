Travelling to ~2005, when i first met with building OpenGL powered applications.
These were my first attempts to realtime rendering, and i found a lot of influence from demoscene projects these days.
Watch out, you will not find super optimized demos here, these were my lessons to get into gamedev one day.

# Synopsis

This Time Travel repository serves me as a tribute to the time spent in coding. Hell a lot of coding when i was around 20-23 yold.
These basic demoscene things hooked me into Gamedev for a long time - some of these time travels you can also find on my github.
However at some point in time i rememer working with groups like **Hoodlum**, but can't find my releases, gotta dig deeper!

# Binaries

Luckily some EXE's still work, i used Wine to fire them up and hell yeah it's a monster travel!
Can't recall some of the logos, sentences used but since they were part of my _Demoscene_ exploration,
they might be out of the blue ;-)
