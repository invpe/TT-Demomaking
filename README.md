Travelling to ~2008, when i first met with building OpenGL powered applications.
These were my first attempts to realtime rendering, and i found a lot of influence from demoscene projects these days.
Watch out, you will not find super optimized demos here, these were my lessons to get into gamedev one day.

This Time Travel repository serves me as a tribute to the time spent in coding. Hell a lot of coding when i was around 23 yold.
These basic demoscene things hooked me into Gamedev for a long time - some of these time travels you can also find on my github.
However at some point in time i rememer working with groups like **Hoodlum**, but can't find my releases, gotta dig deeper!

Luckily some EXE's still work, i used Wine to fire them up and hell yeah it's a monster travel!
Can't recall some of the logos, sentences used but since they were part of my _Demoscene_ exploration,
they might be out of the blue ;-)
