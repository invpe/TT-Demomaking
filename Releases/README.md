These are working with Wine running Linux Mint on `Linux 5.15.0-87-generic #97-Ubuntu SMP Mon Oct 2 21:09:21 UTC 2023 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux`
Even the audio is working, super ;-)

For some of them i found dates for the EXE files, which i'll place as a reference point in the time travel.

Cant recall correctly, maybe this was to be used in some cracktro or nfo?

I recall this one was used as a test bed in implementing various OpenGL features but also parsing and rendering .3DS files

Definitely part of some submission for use for NFO/TRO kind of work.

This at some point was a viewer to the models used in all the releases, from Demoscene forward.
Cool to see it working today ;-)
