# TiTAN sources 
These are the files i've found for this [TiTAN release](https://github.com/invpe/TTDemoscene/tree/main/Releases#titan-once-more-mar--6--2005).
Don't be fooled, when i say `release`, this was most probably never released - rather played dozens of times on my PC these days.

Nevertheless, i credit everyone who's headers, libs, chunks of code i was using at that time when learning :)
Definitely some or even all of the assets went through bin2hex, including XM modules that i find tasty still today :) 

I've been coding with Visual Studio ~2003-2005, not sure if that still compiles but i doubt.
Looking at it now, it was a good lesson with writing to GL command by command, of course these things don't happen again.
