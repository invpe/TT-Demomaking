# TiTAN sources 
These are the files i've found for this [TiTAN release](https://github.com/invpe/TTDemoscene/tree/main/Releases#titan-once-more-mar--6--2005).
Don't be fooled, when i say `release`, this was most probably never released - rather played dozens of times on my PC these days.

Nevertheless, i credit everyone who's headers, libs, chunks of code i was using at that time when learning :)

I've been coding with Visual Studio ~2003-2005, not sure if that still compiles but i doubt.
